        <p class="font_body">I have recently graduated from high school, and I am passionate about technology, specifically software and web development. I also enjoy reading and thinking, and I'm experimenting with sharing my thoughts on various topics through <a href="/blog/">blog</a> writing. I will attend the University of Texas at Dallas in the fall, studying Computer Science.</p>

        <h1 class="font_header">My Education</h1>
        <p class="font_body">I have graduated from Cathedral High School in Indianapolis "cum Laude" in the top of my class, after taking a rigorous schedule of Advanced Placement classes and earning college credit in AP exams. I scored 1500 on both the PSAT and SAT, and my PSAT score qualifies me as a National Merit Scholarship Finalist, which guarantees me a full tuition, academic scholarship to certain schools, including the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
        <p class="font_body">I also have acquired 29 credit hours at Ivy Tech Community College independently from my high school dual credit classes. These credits are entirely technically oriented towards an Associates in Applied Science in Software Development. I also received most of these credits during my eighth grade year, meaning that completed about one year of college credit toward a degree before entering high school, with a combined GPA of 3.025. Some examples of classes I took are: Programming in C#, Mobile App Development, Web Site Development, and Systems Analysis and Design.</p>
        <p class="font_body">Despite my impressive academic transcripts, most of what I have learned about computer science and software development have been through independent study and exercise. I began learning programming at the age of twelve, and quickly surpassed what introductory YouTube programming playlists could teach me. After a few years of devoted tinkering and development, I had laid a foundation of computer knowledge that extended to learning the fundamental concepts and practice of Java, basic web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the basics of the Linux operating system. From my own self-study, I enrolled at Ivy Tech Community College during my seventh and eighth grade years and found the programming classes to be elementary, compared to what I was learning on my own. During high school, I took one computer science class, the most advanced level focussing on Java programming, and could have taught the class myself. Outside of classes, I began experimenting with full-stack web development, including learning React and NodeJS, along with API programming and database management. This self-explored curriculum enabled me to pursue starting a software company during the summer before my Senior year building a web application to allow my school to livestream classes to students learning from home. This project was enormously instructive, although the home-cooked startup ultimately failed, as discussed below.</p>

      <div class="content" id="portfolio">
        <h1 class="font_header">Technical Portfolio</h1>
        <p class="font_body">Most of my technical ability is best demonstrated through two projects: <a href="https://github.com/joeegan2202/personalweb">this personal showcase/resume website</a>, and my EduStream project (<a href="https://github.com/joeegan2202/edustream-server">server</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joeegan2202/edustream-web">website</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/joeegan2202/edustream-deploy-server">deployed server</a>). Both are written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> on the backend. This website utilizes a SQLite database for blog post content, and the front-end is written in plain HTML/CSS/JS. My EduStream project used a cloud hosted MySQL database and React on the front-end, and the entire app was hosted in the cloud, beginning in AWS before transitioning to DigitalOcean because of pricing. Explore my GitHub for more of my tinkering and experimenting.</p>
