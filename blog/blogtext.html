Politics in the United States has always been integral to the American lifestyle. The nation was founded out of a political revolution, and throughout the country’s history, high literacy rates and the prolificity of newspapers accessible to even the poorest farmer have compelled all US citizens to participate in their government. As religious affiliation and attendance diminishes in recent years, politics and political media have taken the place of a church, where prophets decry their opponents’ immorality and priests offer new campaign promises at the altar of public opinion. The United States is a country defined by its sprawling “manifest destiny” history, and the promise of land waiting to be claimed along with its counterpart in sprawling suburban areas have hollowed out the vibrant communities readily built by the European ancestors in their constrained countries. Where local government is unimportant to the life of most Americans and authentic community is lacking, citizens drift toward political parties and identifications that provide a tribal meaning in their derision of the other.

    The American political culture is defined by action and participation. The “American Experiment” requires a uniting interest in democracy, and throughout the United States’ history, popular opinion has always shown itself in times of struggle. The country is stronger for the value placed on civic participation. However, an overinvestment in the specific mechanisms of modern political activity, primarily the two-party system, has led to a reduction of civic engagement to party affiliation, a trend that constrains the representative intentions of the founders. Citizens are no longer represented by leaders chosen from among them to advocate for their best interests. Instead, citizens have the choice of only two meaningful parties that are defined by their contradiction of the other’s platform. Moreover, the personal appropriation of party platforms has led to a culture that is becoming as polarized as the party platforms.
